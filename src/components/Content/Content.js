            Often in life, we come across the term “relations”. To put it into broad usage, there are multiple other synonyms used in daily life, such as “connections” or “friends” or “acquaintances” and the various et cetera. So, you might be thinking, yeah, it’s a daily use bare bone structure to the abstraction of life, why should we waste our time in contemplating about such a thing, which we have learned about on the go? 

I am not here to force you to contemplate on such things. I am here to ask you to slow down a little and appreciate this convoluted yet intricate network of living beings that nature has provided to us, the fabric of life that allows us to feel alive, that helps us distribute our workload as and when needed and gives us the ability to understand and be in the shoes of the lives of others.

Do you remember a time, when your dad/mom would play with you or just roam you around when you were a child? How about when you held your dog for the first time as a puppy? What about remembering the crazy times we had with our friends, like a drinks night that ended up with lots of dare games? Let’s talk about a universal moment which we all remember-how about looking at your crush, smiling and then getting caught by your friends? Don’t we all remember all those times? The point that I am trying to make is that during all of those moments, no matter how much of a closed-wall person you are, those were moments of genuine joy and happiness. Sure, in the rush of life we take such things along with our connection to them for granted and most of us do nothing but appreciate it after it’s gone from our lives.

How about the professional side of life-when you team up with a workplace acquaintance to complete a dream come true project or when you need help from a workmate to complete certain tasks? Sure, you may complete it and then each individual sets off again on their characteristic path but the camaraderie that was formed, that’s the grease which smoothens the functioning of work when you work together.

In all aspects of life, irrespective of your actions and their associated consequences, relations of multiple kinds will be formed. No life can be fostered to growth and its pinnacle of greatness without the various connections that are formed, which we have come to appreciate less with each successive generation, and from my experience, things that are taken for granted will crumble when you need them the most. The world would be a whole lot better if people would start appreciating the good relations that one enjoys, instead of regretting about the past when they have to let go and part ways.
